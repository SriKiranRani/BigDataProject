# Big Data Project
# Truck Fleet Management
Accidents caused by large trucks remain one of the leading causes of injuries and deaths in the  United States. The objective is identifying dangerous commercial truck drivers nationwide.

# Problem Statement
- ANT is a 10-year-old organization. It has a total 400 employees, and its primary business is long distance trucking services, and they specialize in general and non-specialized cargo types. 
- The high frequency of injuries and fatalities resulting from accidents involving large trucks in the United States necessitates the need to ensure that all drivers in the fleet comply with the corporation's regulations and do not pose an insurance risk due to various factors, presenting a significant challenge for fleet managers.

# Objective
- The aim is to reduce the number of accidents caused by large commercial trucks and ultimately minimize the injuries and deaths resulting from these accidents in California, by analysing each driver's data and implementing measures to mitigate the risks associated with them.
- Eventually, assess and anticipate risk factors related to drivers based on several factors such as events, total distance travelled, average speed, and mileage.
